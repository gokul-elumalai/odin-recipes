        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Roti bread is an unleavened griddle bread from India that is similar to pita bread. Ideally, I use a traditional Indian roti griddle called a "tava."

            Roti (in English known as chapati)[5] is a round flatbread native to the Indian subcontinent. It is popular in India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Maldives, Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Mauritius, and Fiji.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups durum wheat flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir flour, water, oil, and salt together in a medium bowl until well combined and pulling away from the sides. Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface and knead until smooth and pliable, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 12 equal pieces. Form each piece into a round. Working with one round at a time while all others are covered with a damp cloth, flatten with the palm of your hand, then use a rolling pin to roll into 6- to 8-inch diameter circle.</li>
            <li>Heat a dry skillet or tava over medium-high heat. Cook one roti at a time in the hot skillet until golden with some darker brown spots, about 1 minute per side, As it cooks, roll the next roti. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
